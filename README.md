# CMOR 438: Data Science & Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains my final project for CMOR 438: Data Science & Machine Learning, showcasing implementations of key supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms studied throughout the course. 

The project is organized into two main sections:

- Supervised Learning: Algorithms that learn from labeled data to make predictions.
- Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms that analyze and find hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

Each algorithm is demonstrated on a dataset, with code, results, and analyses provided.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AllenDong102/CMOR-438.git
```

2. Navigate to any algorithm's folder. Example:
```bash
cd Supervised_Learning/Linear_Regression
```

3. Run the code:
- Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Google Colab.
- Or run Python scripts directly if applicable.

4. Follow individual README.md files for specific instructions.
